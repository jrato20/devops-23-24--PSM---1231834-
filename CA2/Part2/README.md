# Class Assignment 2

## Introduction

The goal of this class assignment was to use or personal repositories and use a basic gradle application to introduce new features. Although the features are simple, the goal is to understand how a gradle wrapper works and operates and to edit the build.gradle file.

## Getting Started

The first step is to create a new branch called "tut-basic-gradle" in the repository to work on the assignment. To do so, open a git bash and type in the command:
```bash
git branch tut-basic-gradle
```

After creating the branch, switch to it by typing:
```bash
git checkout tut-basic-gradle
```

1. Go to [this website](https://start.spring.io) to generate a new gradle spring boot project. Fill in the necessary information and add the needed dependencies according to the image below:
   ![img_1.png](Images/img.png)

2. Click on the "Generate" button and download the project. Extract the files to the CA2 Part2 folder.

3. Open the project in IntelliJ and delete de **src** folder.

4. Copy the **src** folder from Class Assignment 1 Part 1 to the project folder.
5. Copy the **webpack.config.js** and the **package.json** files from Class Assignment 1 Part 1 to the project folder.
6. Delete the **src/main/resources/static/built/** folder.
7. In the **Employee.java** class, change all *javax.persistence* imports to *jakarta.persistence*.

## Implementing Changes
### Part 1: Adding the frontend plugin

For this first section, the goal is to add a frontend plugin to our gradle project. The steps to do so are:

1. Open the build.gradle file and add the plugin:
```gradle
 id "org.siouan.frontend-jdk17" version "8.0.0"
```

2. Configure the plugin in the same build.gradle file:
```gradle
 frontend {
nodeVersion = "16.20.2"
assembleScript = "run build"
cleanScript = "run clean"
checkScript = "run check"
}
```

3. Add the dependencies in the build.gradle file:
```gradle
"scripts": {
"webpack": "webpack",
"build": "npm run webpack",
"check": "echo Checking frontend",
"clean": "echo Cleaning frontend",
"lint": "echo Linting frontend",
"test": "echo Testing frontend"
},
```
4. Add the package manager to the build.gradle file, before the scripts section:
```gradle
"packageManager": "npm@9.6.7",
```

5. Compile the project in the terminal(first navigate to the project folder):
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Part 2: Adding the copyJar task

For this part of the assignment, a new task will be added to copy the generated Jar file. The steps to do so are:

1. Open the build.gradle file and add the task:
```gradle
task copyJar(type: Copy){
	dependsOn build

	from "$buildDir/libs"
	into "$projectDir/dist"

	include '**/*.jar'
}
```

2. Compile the project in the terminal(first navigate to the project folder):
```bash
./gradlew build
```
3. Add all te files to the staging area:
```bash
git add .
```
4. Commit the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Added the copyJar task"
```
5. Push the changes to the repository:
```bash
git push
```

### Part 3: Adding the deleteWebpackFiles task

For this part of the assignment, a new task will be added to delete the files generated by the webpack. The steps to do so are:

1. Open the build.gradle file and add the task:
```gradle
task cleanWebpack(type: Delete) {
	delete 'src/main/resources/static/built'
}
```

2. Compile the project in the terminal(first navigate to the project folder):
```bash
./gradlew build
```
3. Add all te files to the staging area:
```bash
git add .
```
4. Commit the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Added the cleanWebpackFiles task"
```
5. Push the changes to the repository:
```bash
git push
```
### Part 4: Merging the branches

Now we need to merge to the master branch. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Switch to the main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```
2. Merge the tut-basic-gradle branch:
```bash
git merge --no-ff tut-basic-gradle
```
3. Push the changes to the repository:
```bash
git push
```

## Alternative implementation solution
An alternative solution to the assignment would be to use a different solution for the build automation tool. Instead of using Gradle, we could use Maven. Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It is similar to Gradle but uses an XML file to define the project's structure and dependencies. The steps to implement the changes using Maven would be:
1. Create a new Maven project by using the following command:
```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```
2. Add the frontend plugin to the project by adding the following code to the pom.xml file:
```xml
<plugin>
<groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
<artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<version>1.11.0</version>
<configuration>
<nodeVersion>v16.20.2</nodeVersion>
<workingDirectory>src/main/resources/static</workingDirectory>
</configuration>
<executions>
<execution>
<id>install node and npm</id>
<goals>
<goal>install-node-and-npm</goal>
</goals>
</execution>
<execution>
<id>npm install</id>
<goals>
<goal>npm</goal>
<configuration>
<arguments>install</arguments>
</configuration>
</goals>
</execution>
<execution>
<id>npm run build</id>
<goals>
<goal>npm</goal>
<configuration>
<arguments>run build</arguments>
</configuration>
</goals>
</execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
```
3. Add the copyJar task to the project by adding the following code to the pom.xml file:
```xml
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.2.0</version>
<executions>
<execution>
<id>copy-jar</id>
<phase>package</phase>
<goals>
<goal>copy-resources</goal>
</goals>
<configuration>
<outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/dist</outputDirectory>
<resources>
<resource>
<directory>${project.build.directory}</directory>
<includes>
<include>*.jar</include>
</includes>
</resource>
</resources>
</configuration>
</execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
```
4. Add the deleteWebpackFiles task to the project by adding the following code to the pom.xml file:
```xml
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-clean-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.1.0</version>
<executions>
<execution>
<id>delete-webpack-files</id>
<phase>clean</phase>
<goals>
<goal>clean</goal>
</goals>
<configuration>
<filesets>
<fileset>
<directory>src/main/resources/static/built</directory>
<includes>
<include>*</include>
</includes>
</fileset>
</filesets> 
</configuration>
</execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
```
5. Compile the project by using the following command:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
6. Add all the files to the staging area by using the following command:
```bash
git add .
```
7. Commit the changes by using the following command:
```bash
git commit -m "Added the Maven build automation tool"
```
8. Push the changes to the repository by using the following command:
```bash
git push
```
